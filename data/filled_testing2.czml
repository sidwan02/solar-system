Its sensor is designed by the ITT Exelis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The satellite, now known as Earth, was originally scheduled for April 2008 but lost its 30-day launch slot to a U.S. government mission which had been delayed. It was rescheduled for launch August 22, 2008 from Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard a Delta II launch vehicle. The launch was postponed to September 4, 2008, due to unavailability of the Big Crow telemetry-relay aircraft. It was delayed again to September 6 because Hurricane Hanna interfered with its launch crews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The launch took place successfully on September 6, 2008 at 11:50:57 a.m. PDT (18:50:57 UTC). The Earth satellite separated successfully from its Delta II launch vehicle at 12:49 p.m. PDT (19:49 UTC), 58 minutes and 56 seconds after launch.</p>",
